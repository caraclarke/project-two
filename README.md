My website is called Crosshatch and it is an interactive site for people who love crafting and being creative. There are DIY project posts as well as workshops you can RSVP to that happen once or repeat on a weekly/monthly basis.

Users who are registered and logged in can create posts about DIY projects, workshops and RSVP to workshops. They can also view and update their profile information. Users can add pictures to their profile and any projects or workshops they create.

Visitors who are not registered or logged in can view the list of projects and workshops, but cannot RSVP.

I used HTML/CSS, jQuery and AJAX on my front end to create a functional and responsive website.

My goals for this site are to eventually have users be able to favorite or save projects and workshops, as well as add comments. I also want to continue to update the design of my site and create a more consistent layout and color scheme.

I used my user stories to walk me through how I wanted my game to go and what I wanted them to see/feel. (link below)

I sketched out some simple wireframes since I wasn't sure how much content would be displayed on the page and have attached a picture of my sketches below.
